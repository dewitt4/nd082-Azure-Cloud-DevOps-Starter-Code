# Azure Infrastructure Operations Project: Deploying a scalable IaaS web server in Azure

### Introduction
For this project, you will write a Packer template and a Terraform template to deploy a customizable, scalable web server in Azure.

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository

2. Create your infrastructure as code

3. Update this README to reflect how someone would use your code.

### Dependencies
1. Create an [Azure Account](https://portal.azure.com) 
2. Install the [Azure command line interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
3. Install [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads)
4. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

### Instructions
Before we get started, we want to create a policy that ensures all indexed resources are tagged. This will help us with organization and tracking, and make it easier to log when things go wrong. We will do this by creating and applying a Tagging Policy. Create a policy that ensures all indexed resources in your subscription have tags and deny deployment if they do not.
